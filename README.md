This is my first application using Ruby on Rails following the book "Agile Web Development with Rails 4e (Rails 3.1) - Ruby, Thomas, Hansson - Pragmatic (2011)"

This is a basic web application that provides e-Commerce functionality.

Following Agile Development and using Rails framework, this application is a practical example of:
- Data and class modeling
- Input validation
- Scaffolding 
- Unit testing
- Functional testing
